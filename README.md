Wikilinks is a parsing framework for Wikipedia. It is based on the code of the wikiwsd project by Paul Laufer
(xml dump processing) and code by Daniel Lamprecht for parsing HTML text. The framework extracts the id, revision, and
title of an article form the xml dump. Redirects are resoleved using the xml dump. The corresponding HTML for each article is then crawled from the wikipedia api and processed.
For each link (source_article_id-target_article_id in the links table) in the zero namespace of wikipedia it extracts then the following information:
target_position_in_text - target link's position in text
target_position_in_text_only - target link's position in text only, all links in tables are ignored
target_position_in_section - position in section
target_position_in_section_in_text_only -  target link's position in section only, all links in tables of the section are ignored
section_name - the name of the section
section_number - the number of the section
target_position_in_table - position of the target link in the table
table_number - the number of the table
table_css_class - the cascading style sheed class of the table (can be used to classify the tables, i.e., infobox, navibox, etc.)
table_css_style - further styling of the table, extraced from the style element of the table tag (can be used to classify the tables, i.e., infobox, navibox, etc.)
target_x_coord_1920_1080 - the x coorodinate of the visual position of the left upper corner of the target link for resoluion 1920x1080
target_y_coord_1920_1080 - the y coorodinate of the visual position of the left upper corner of the target link for resoluion 1920x1080
target_position_in_paragraph - the position of the target link in paragraph
paragraph_number - the number of the paragraph

For each article in the article table we also extract the corresponding web page length of the rendered html and store it in the
field page_length_1920_1080 of the table page_length. The page lenght can be used in different ways, e.g., normalization.
